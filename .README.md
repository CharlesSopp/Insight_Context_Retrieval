## Set Up

To download required python packages, run ```poetry install``` from the root directory.

To populate and store locally the vector databases and close note summaries, run ```python intialise_data.py```. 

Note, this requires upload of a .csv or .xlsx file for the close note summaries inside ```/data/Closed_Incident_Data/```, and .json files for each previously closed incident inside ```/data/Incoming_Incident_Data/```.
